Todo list:
- junit coverage
- cascade updates of the main TirNaNog jar and DB scripts
- DB script update mechanism (liquibase integrates with spring boot)
- settings propagation throughout the system
- pull timer and other utils out into its own utils project to be used as a dependency in the TirNaNog core and capability projects


TirNaNog Capability functionality:
- local socket connection for all capabilities, they can be started independently
- capabilities are independently running applications using a TirNaNog interface
- a capability connects to the TirNaNog application, TirNaNog only accepts these connections (capability = client, TirNaNog = server)
